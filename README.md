# Health Record System - Backend

This is the backend for the Health Record Management System project.  
It is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **OrientDB** for database management.  
The backend supports authentication using **JWT**, and exposes RESTful APIs for managing healthcare providers, citizens, appointments, medical records, prescriptions, facilities, and user accounts.

## Features

- REST API endpoints for all core modules
- JWT-based authentication middleware for secure routes
- Connection to OrientDB graph/document database
- Error handling and input validation (to be expanded)
- Modular architecture with controllers, routes, and middlewares

## Getting Started
